# Iris layout for github user jbtompkins (reddit: u/nuclear_wizard_)

This is a Dvorak layout for the Iris that incorporates keys that the Iris
board does not have room for in the lower function layer while the upper 
function layer makes the top row into function keys (starting with F12 on the
Esc key then going through F1 to F11) and a numpad on the left board.
