# Keeb.io Iris Configuration by u/nuclear_wizard_ (github: jbtompkins)

## Description
A Dvorak based layout for the Iris that incorporates keys that the Iris board does not have room for in the lower function layer while the upper function layer makes the top row into function keys (starting with F12 on the Esc key then going through F1 to F11) and a numpad on the left board.
