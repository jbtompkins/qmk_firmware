# Clueboard Layout for github user jbtompkins (reddit: u/nuclear_wizard_)

This layout is basically the default Clueboard layout in Dvorak with the
exception of the two separate keys that are by default Page Up and Page Down.
These are changed back to what they were originally (and printed on the PCB):
Insert and Delete, since the up and down arrows on the function layer already
have Page Up and Page down set by default.
